Create sample patient data in structured format

## Problem

Innovative companies struggle to create healthcare solutions due to limited access to test data and environments, as health data is sensitive and cannot be easily shared. Non-personally identifiable datasets are urgently needed for testing and developing technical solutions.

## Solution

One solution is a software tool for generating synthetic test patient data that adheres to standards such as FHIR. It overcomes limitations in accessing real patient data and promotes innovation by simulating various scenarios, thereby refining healthcare solutions.
