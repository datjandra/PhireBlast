Create sample patient data in structured format

## Problem

Innovative companies face a major hurdle in creating healthcare solutions due to limited access to test data and environments. Health data is sensitive and cannot be readily shared for development purposes. Thus, there's a pressing need to construct non-personally identifiable datasets for testing and developing technical solutions.

## Solution

Generating synthetic test patient data that adheres to healthcare standards like FHIR addresses the issue of limited access to real patient data for healthcare solutions development. This approach involves creating realistic yet anonymized records to simulate diverse healthcare scenarios, ensuring data privacy and security. Synthetic data facilitates efficient refinement and validation of technical solutions while promoting collaboration and innovation across organizations in the healthcare industry.
